# esp-wmata-pids

Firmware repo for a custom Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) Passenger Information Display Screen (PIDS) running off an esp32. The firmware fetches upcoming train arrivals from the public WMATA api and drives an led display, like the real displays at the train station.

Currently, the firmware is not yet capable of outputting to the display. More information will be added soon, including the hardware setup used in development.
